freqselector
============

This jQuery freqselector plugin allows you to build a widget that looks and behaves like a frequency selector on one of an old radio.
To function, this jQuery plugin needs [overscroll](https://github.com/azoff/overscroll) and [scrollTo](https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo).

Check out the demo.html on how to use it.

Enjoy!
